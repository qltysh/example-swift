# Qlty Swift Coverage Example

[Qlty](https://qlty.sh) is a Code Health Platform with support for code coverage.

This repository is an example using Qlty to track code coverage for a Swift project. Coverage data is generated with a Swift command line argument, and then exported into an lcov format.

## Requirements

- macOS (for `xcrun` and LLVM tools)
- Swift toolchain
- Xcode Command Line Tools
- An account on [Qlty Cloud](https://qlty.sh) (free)

> [!NOTE]
>
> This repository is using GitHub's OpenID Connect (OIDC) to authenticate the coverage upload with Qlty Cloud instead of storing a coverage token as a GitHub Actions secret.

## Set up

See [`.github/workflows/main.yml`](./.github/workflows/main.yml) in this repository for a basic configuration.
